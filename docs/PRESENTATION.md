## Slide 6: AI Chatbot Demo

### Example Interaction

**User**: "Analyze logs from last 30 minutes"

**AI Response**:
```
Summary:
- Total Logs: 5,234
- Errors: 47
- Warnings: 156
- Time Range: 23:30 - 00:00

Issues Found:
1. Database Timeout (Severity: HIGH)
   - 34 occurrences
   - Services affected: auth-service, user-service
   
2. Payment Gateway Failure (Severity: MEDIUM)
   - 13 occurrences
   - Card declined by issuer

Root Cause Analysis:
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Likely cause: Increased traffic without scaling

Recommendations:
1. Increase database connection pool size
2. Add connection timeout monitoring
3. Scale database horizontally

Suggested Queries:
- level:ERROR AND service:database
- message:"connection timeout"
```
